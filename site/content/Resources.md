## Additional Resources

 - [SDL_GPU Documentation](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU) 
 - [SDL_gpu_examples repo](https://github.com/TheSpydog/SDL_gpu_examples/)
 - [The Graphics Programming Discord Website](https://graphics-programming.org/)
    - They've got links to both their own content and interesting Graphics Blogs!
 - [SDL GPU API Concepts: Data Transfer and Cycling](https://moonside.games/posts/sdl-gpu-concepts-cycling/)
    - Written by Evan Hemsley, this article explains the GPU API concept called cycling. We'll get there eventually, but this is written from the source, highly recommended! 
 - [SDL GPU API Concepts: Sprite Batcher](https://moonside.games/posts/sdl-gpu-sprite-batcher/)
    - Written by Evan Hemsley as his answer to folks who want shaders but are coming from the [SDL_Renderer](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryRender). Fantastic article on the design of a simple sprite batcher to solve the main things people use the built-in renderer for. We'll try to build up to examples like this, but we likely won't speak about the design of a pipeline at this length.

## Get help:
 - [SDL Discord](https://discord.gg/BwpFGBWsv8)
    - We can help with both SDL and SDL_GPU questions here. Though don't expect to get incredibly high end 3D graphics advice here. We're still building out that section of the community now that we have SDL_GPU.
 - [SDL Forum](https://discourse.libsdl.org/)
 - [The Graphics Programming Discord](https://discord.graphics-programming.org/)
    - There's even an SDL_GPU channel! These folks are probably where you want to go to with the more serious Graphics questions.
