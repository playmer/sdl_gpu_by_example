A site dedicated to learn SDL GPU and Graphics one step at a time. Folks familiar with existing APIs should feel comfortable skipping around.

Most of the following lessons actual prose hasn't been started, or have at best have loose partial outlines. That said, we have examples up through the Vertex and Index Buffers lesson, although we're still tweaking all of the examples as we move along. The titles will say the status at the end, unless they're mostly complete, which is just the first two at time of writing.
