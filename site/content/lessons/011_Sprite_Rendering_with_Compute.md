title: Sprite Rendering with Compute
description: Now that we've covered the breadth of beginner rendering, it's time to start getting deeper into the structure of things and how we can render more efficiently.

Compute is perhaps not the _fastest_ way to render sprites, but it's a pretty good one, and depending on your use case, it might be better for you. It will also allow us to go over compute, as well as layer on a few techniques such as compute culling and Indirect Rendering that you'll be able to learn and reuse later on. Don't worry too much though, the "pull style" of Sprite Rendering is essentially embedded within this one, so I'll discuss how you might do things differently to switch to that.
